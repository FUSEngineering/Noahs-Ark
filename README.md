# CommitsInGit

This assignment asks you to look at book covers from O'Reilly Publications 
Find a book with an iconic animal on the cover that is not already in the 'animals.txt' file
1) add that book's information to the 'animals.txt' file in the same format and your name
2) commit those changes to the repository
3) pull the commits from other students and merge(integrate) them into your local copy (maybe there are some?)
4) push the merged/integrated 'animals.txt' file to the class repository.
